Automatically (hopefully) updated spec files for the [Floorp](https://floorp.app/) browser packaged for Fedora. Based on the works from [the4runner](https://github.com/the4runner/firefox-dev) and [LovecraftianGodsKiller](https://github.com/LovecraftianGodsKiller/floorp). The Copr repo for this package [can be located here](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/sneexy/floorp).

If you have any issues with the package itself, feel free to report but I may not be able to fix it as this is my first time managing a package such as this. Feel free to contribute if you'd like if you can fix any issues yourself!

This package *may or may not* be broken for users on Immutable/Atomic Fedora, although this issue may only be related to users using custom [Universal Blue](https://universal-blue.org/)/[BlueBuild](https://blue-build.org/) images. [You can see my fix here.](https://github.com/sernik-tech/member-images/blob/main/config/scripts/system-wuzetka.sh#L12-L16)

An unofficial RPM package of [Firefox Developer Edition](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/developer) designed for [Fedora](https://getfedora.org).

## ⚠️ Special Note
This is just an RPM packaging for the said software and does not include any licenses of its own. The only additional file included is the `.desktop` file written based on the original executable from the Firefox Release Channel (default).

## About the Application
This is a pre-beta release of Mozilla Firefox intended for Web developers and
enthusiasts who want early access to new features. It receives new updates
(almost) daily, adding and refining support for the very latest Web standards
that won't make it into the stable release of Firefox for some months. It also
comes with some addons for Web development enabled by default.

You may find that Developer Edition works just fine for everyday
use: Some users set it as their default Web browser. You can sign in to your
normal Firefox account and sync your preferences, extensions, and bookmarks,
etc. Or you can keep the Firefox versions separate, and use different profiles,
even different browser UI themes. Firefox Developer Edition can install
alongside the stable release of Firefox, making it easy to switch back and forth
between the two versions.

That being said, a lot of the technology here is still experimental, and there
will very likely be some bugs, so just remember that by using Developer Edition,
you're helping Mozilla make Firefox the best Web browser they can. And have fun!

Bugs related to Firefox Developer Edition should be reported directly to Mozilla: [https://bugzilla.mozilla.org](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org)
